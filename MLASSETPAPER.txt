1.1 Primary contributions 
	- give more informations about the power of ML in prediction and measuring the risk premia
	- ML can play a big role in the pricing of the empirical assets
	
1.2 What's ML 
	- ML def depends from the context
	- ML uses a collection of high-dimentional models for statisticalprediction + regularization methods, in order to search some specific potentials for our model 
	- In our Case a better approximation of risk premia 
1.3 Why apply ML to Asset Pricing 
	Three aspects of machine learning make it well suited for problems of ambiguous functional form : 
	- The first is its diversity. As a suite of dissimilar methods it casts a wide net in its specification search. 
	- Second, with methods ranging from generalized linear models to regression trees and neural networks, machine learning is explicitly 
	designed to approximate complex nonlinear associations.
	- Third, parameter penalization and conservative model selection criteria complement the breadth of functional forms 
	spanned by these methods in order to avoid overfit biases and false discovery.
1.4 What specific ML methods do we study 
	- linear regression	
	- partial list squares 
	- regression trees
	- neural networks
