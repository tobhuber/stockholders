\section{Introduction}

	The authors of the article compare and evaluate various machine learning methods
	in how successfully they are able to predict equity risk premia.
	The aim of the paper is not only to justify the economic benefit of using machine
	learning in predicting equity returns, but to additionally find the major variables
	that can aid in explaining the behaviour of the risk premia.
	Furthermore, the authors clarify the suitability of machine learning to this
	task through its general affinity towards prediction tasks,
	the ability to eliminate highly correlated variables,
	as well as its aptitude for problems with obscure form.
	The limitation of machine learning is also recognized as its inability
	to autonomously determine deep-seated relations between asset prices
	and conditioning factors. In order to answer the research question,
	the following methods were employed:
