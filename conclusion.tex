\section{Conclusion}

In this paper we have tried to make 2 points clear. The first was that Machine Learning could help us
 a lot in prediction and measuring the risk premia 
and that we can rely on its Machine predictions and Measures. 
To achieve those goals we have analysed the methods which were listed in the origin paper and their caracteristics
and which factors could play roles in their returns.
We found thqt the Results can be differentiated into stock return predictions and portfolio return predictions.
Another point which was highlighted in the paper was that machine learning methods are able to predict on a long and short timeline.
Furthermore it was proved that the most influential characteristics were unaffected by noise, thus confirming the
robustness of the results returned by Machine Learning.
About the best models for Machine Learning we found that Non-linear models perform the best and are the most consistent with neural networks.
All those analysis and results approve that Machine Learning has a very high accuracy of predicted returns and we can rely on it
in many parts of our financial researchs and predictions.
