\subsection{Perfomance Evaluation}
For the assessment of the performance for stock return forecasts the authors calculate the out-of-sample $R^{2}_{oos}$ for each method.
The out-of-sample $R^{2}_{oos}$ is furthermore modified according to the use case to provide high accuracy on the measurement of indiviual stock returns.
To evaluate the results of our analysis, the respective $R^{2}_{oos}$ for each method is then compared among themselves and to industry benchmarks.
