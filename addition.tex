\subsection{Perfomance Evaluation}
For the assessment of the performance of stock return forecasts the authors calculate the out-of-sample $R^{2}_{oos}$ for each method.
This $R^{2}_{oos}$ is further modified according to the use case to provide high accuracy on the measurement of indiviual stock returns.
To evaluate the results of the analysis, the respective $R^{2}_{oos}$ for each method is then compared to each other and to industry benchmarks.

\subsection{Variable Importance and Marginal Relationships}
In order to determine the significance of each conditioning variable two methods are used. First, the change in panel predictive $R^{2}$ is measured when changing the value of the variable being tested to 0 and holding all other variable values the same. Secondly, the sum of squared partial derivatives is used to deduce how sensitive the model is to shifts in that variable.
